# facepunch-api
A new and working api for the Facepunch forum

## Status
I have finally found out how to scrape the new site, that uses Vue.js, and I'm currently working hard on making the site readable, through the api.

## What can be scraped?
- Forums page
- Forum pages
- Threads

It still needs a bit of work, but it's a great POC that FP can be scraped for API use.
